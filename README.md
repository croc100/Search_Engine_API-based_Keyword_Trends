# Real-time Popular Keywords Retrieval

This Python script fetches real-time popular keywords using the Google Custom Search JSON API. You can set the country code to get popular keywords specific to a country.

## Prerequisites

Before using the script, you'll need the following:

- API key obtained from the Google Developers Console.
- Google Custom Search Engine (CSE) ID.
- Country code (e.g., 'us' for the United States, 'kr' for South Korea).

## Usage

1. Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your API key.
2. Replace `'YOUR_CSE_ID'` with your Google CSE ID.
3. Set the `'country_code'` variable to the desired country code.
4. Run the script to retrieve the top 10 real-time popular keywords.

## Example

Here's an example of how to run the script:

```shell
python get_popular_keywords.py
